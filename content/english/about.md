# ABOUT

We are a game dev studio trying our best to make polished, high-quality game content. Sometimes unconventional, sometimes eccentric, and that's okay. We love games and see them for the art-form they are and the unique experiences they can bring for people.

We have a tightly knit group of individuals who work well together and aren't afraid to get things done.
